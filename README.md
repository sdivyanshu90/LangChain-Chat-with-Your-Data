# 🌟 LangChain: Chat with Your Data

Welcome! 👋

This repository contains the **notebooks for the course “LangChain: Chat with Your Data”**, created in collaboration with **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** and **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)**.

In this course, you’ll learn how to build applications that let you **interactively chat with your own data**. Each notebook introduces a concept step by step, with plenty of examples so you can learn by doing.

## 📚 What You’ll Learn

The course is organized into six main parts:

### 1. Document Loading

- Bring your own data into a LangChain app.
- Work with different file types like PDFs, text files, and web pages.
- Understand loaders that make unstructured data easier to use.

### 2. Document Splitting

- Large documents can overwhelm a model.
- Learn how to break documents into smaller chunks while keeping context intact.
- Prepare your data for embedding and retrieval.

### 3. Vectorstores & Embeddings

- Turn your text into embeddings (numerical representations).
- Store and manage embeddings in **vectorstores**, which let you search by meaning instead of keywords.
- Learn why embeddings are the foundation of “chat with your data.”

### 4. Retrieval

- Find the most relevant chunks of data when answering a question.
- Connect embeddings to real-world queries.
- Explore different retrieval strategies and how they affect performance.

### 5. Question Answering (QA)

- Build systems that give grounded answers from your data.
- Combine retrieval with large language models (LLMs).
- See how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) works in practice.

### 6. Chatbot Integration

- Put it all together into an interactive chatbot.
- Let users ask questions and get conversational responses based on your documents.
- Learn best practices for creating reliable and useful chat experiences.
